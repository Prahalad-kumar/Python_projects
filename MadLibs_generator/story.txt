"A Day at the Zoo”
Today I went to the zoo with my <person>. We saw a huge <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its cage. It looked at us and started <verb> really <adverb>.
Then, I noticed a <color> <animal> that tried to steal my <food>. I shouted, “Hey! That’s my <food>!” but it just <verb_past> away.
After that, we watched the zookeeper feed the <plural_noun>. He said they eat <noun> every day!
Before we left, I bought a <adjective> souvenir that looks like a <animal>. It was the best <noun> ever!
I can’t wait to go back to the zoo with my <person> again!
